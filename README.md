# Healthcare-Appointment-No-Show-Prediction
Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction
This project aims to predict whether patients will miss their scheduled healthcare appointments, enabling healthcare providers to optimize scheduling and reduce no-show rates. By leveraging historical appointment data, we identify key factors contributing to missed appointments and provide actionable insights.

# Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:

Develop a predictive model to identify patients at high risk of missing appointments.

Analyze trends and patterns in appointment data to understand the root causes of no-shows.

Provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing appointment scheduling and patient engagement strategies.

# Tools and Technologies Used
# Python

Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

Scikit-learn (Sklearn): For building and training the decision tree prediction model.

# Power BI: For creating an interactive dashboard to visualize insights and trends related to appointment no-shows.

# Deliverables
Prediction Model: A trained decision tree model capable of predicting patient no-shows.

Power BI Insight Dashboard: An interactive dashboard showcasing key trends such as the impact of SMS reminders, age demographics, and weekday on no-show rates.

Optimization Recommendations: Practical recommendations derived from data analysis to improve appointment attendance and operational efficiency.

# Key Insights
The Power BI dashboard provides visualizations and insights into various factors influencing no-shows, including:

SMS Reminders: Analysis of the effectiveness of SMS reminders in reducing no-show rates.

Age: Impact of patient age on appointment attendance.

Weekday: Correlation between the day of the week and no-show occurrences.

Gender: Breakdown of no-show rates by gender.

Neighborhood: Geographical analysis of no-show rates.

Month: Monthly trends in no-show rates.

Disease: Distribution of no-shows across different disease categories.

This project offers a comprehensive solution for healthcare providers to proactively manage appointment no-shows, leading to improved resource utilization and better patient care.
